# gradiometry_results

This repository contains wave gradiometry results for 2000 USArray TA stations from 700 earthquakes.
Each directory contains results for periods ranging from 20 s to 150 s. The directory name denotes the orignial time of the event, and more detailes can be found from the events_catalog file.
Within each result file, the first column represents the longtidue, the second column represents the latitude, the third column represents Ax, the fourth column represents Ay, the fifth column represents Bx, the sixth column represents By, the seventh column represents the Vx(dynamic), the eighth column represents Vy(dynamic), the ninth column represents Vx(structural), the tenth column represents Vy(structural), the eleventh column represents the azimuth variation, the twelveth column represents the radiation pattern, the thirteenth column represents the geometrical spreading.
