# gradiometry_results

This repository contains wave gradiometry results for 2000 USArray TA stations from 700 earthquakes.

Each directory contains results for periods ranging from 20 s to 150 s. The directory name denotes the orignial time of the event, and more detailes can be found from the events_catalog file.

Within each result file:
the 1st column represents the longtidue,
the 2nd column represents the latitude, 
the 3rd column represents Ax, 
the 4th column represents Ay, 
the 5th column represents Bx, the sixth column represents By, 
the 7th column represents the dynamic velociy, 
the 8th column represents the structural velocity, 
the 9th column represents the azimuth variation, 
the 10th column represents the radiation pattern,
the 11th column represents the geometrical spreading.
